# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles that I use to improve my daily routine as software developer.

## Tools

Below are some tools that I've use.

* [zsh and oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki)

## Packages

My favorites packages and libs. Currently I use Ubuntu as my OS, but on the next month I wanna change it. And start to use some linux based on Archlinux.

* [googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler)
* [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/install/)
* [translate-shell](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell)


## TODO
* Create shell script to install environment automatically
* Complete tools list
